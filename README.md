# HATE SPEECH IDENTIFICATION






# Hate Speech Identification Dataset

# About the Data
This dataset utilizes Twitter data and was created for research purposes in hate-speech identification. The text is classified into three categories: hate-speech, offensive language, and neither. It is crucial to note that the dataset contains text that may be considered racist, sexist, homophobic, or generally offensive.

# Problem Statement
Identifying and detecting hate speech represents a pressing challenge in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) systems. Hate speech includes offensive language, discriminatory comments, and expressions of prejudice directed at individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or other protected characteristics. Effective mechanisms for hate speech detection are crucial for maintaining the security of online spaces and fostering an environment that promotes peace and inclusivity.
